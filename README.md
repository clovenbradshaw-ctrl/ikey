# iKey

Secure personal information with zero-knowledge encryption. Only your QR code can unlock your data.

## About

iKey helps you generate and manage a secure QR code for your personal information. Public details can assist responders, while private data stays encrypted and can only be unlocked with your password.

The QR code itself is static and never changes. When information needs to be revised, new data is saved to the archive while the original QR image remains the same.

## Development

This repository contains the iKey web application and related assets.
